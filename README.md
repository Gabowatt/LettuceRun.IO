For this project we want to create a Nutrition app that will help people stay in shape, eat right and engage in healthy competition. To make this type of application less dull and more dynamic we decided to implement a progression system, in which the user will gain EXP by completing a set of task and challenges to level up. Every challenge will have a different difficulty level the higher the level the more EXP the user will gain. This will help the user to do better and to strive more, to achieve his ultimate goal. There will be weekly challenges, daily challenges and tier challenges so there is plenty of opportunity to gain EXP. Weekly challenges as well as Daily challenges are not mandatory, but tier challenges are.If the user does not comply with the tier challenges he will not gain EXP and he will not progress to next challenge.That being said the user will have 3 tiers to choose from when he registers: Beginner: is for people that want to look good, but not go overboard with their diet. Intermediate: is for people that already in good shape, but the want to go to next level. Advance: Is for people that already really good shape ,but they try new recipes and stay fit.
